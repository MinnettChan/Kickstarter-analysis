# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Perform an analysis regarding the outcomes of Theater projects and making a deeper analysis on the plays sub-category.
### Purpose
Know the outcomes and their behavior of the campaigns for Theater's on different dates and considering the goals for plays.
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis can help Louise for having a better perspective of the different campaigns and have solid conclusions based on reliable information. This analysis ables to see if the campaigns are really working and provide information to make better decisions.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first image can show us that the successful projects have diminished over the time but the failed keep a stable tendency. On the other hand, it's more likely that the projects are completed since the cancelled numbers are very little compared to the amount of launched projects.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second image can show us that the projects involving plays on theater whith tinier goals are more successful. There were no cancelations regarding the plays. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For creating this analysis I didn't faced difficulties since I have worked with excel for a log time and my job is also based on this program. This analysis though and, from my perspective, only tells you a small part of the whole information so it may be interesting to encompass other campaigns so a comparison can be carried out and see if this is efficient.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. There is a downward trend on successful outcome in the Theater category so it's needed to review what is going on so the tendency can change.
2. In general, the Theater campaigns are successful as they represent 61.28% of the total Theater campaigns. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The subcategory of plays in the Theater category is showing that is more likely to fail when the goals get bigger. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is only one subcategory analized so it would be better to have more data to analyze the behavior of other subcategories and compare them so a better decision can be taken. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other possible graph that could be interesting is a bar graph of the outcomes by year, so Louise can be aware of the historical information and check the tendencies on it. 
A recommendation is to include other subcategories for a better comparison of the campaigns.
